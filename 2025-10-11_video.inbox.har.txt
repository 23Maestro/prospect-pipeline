We start with the amount of clips and total run time = 35 max clips / 4 minutes 30 seconds to meet college coach preferences. Clips are arranged to lead with your best plays, maintain flow and consistency, and finish strong. Hudl is the preferred way to edit your clips, it ultimately depends on what you guys need.  I see you play Safety - if you had plays on Offense too, we'd organize them by Defensive and Offensive Plays. I reviewed your first 6 plays and wouldn’t change a thing!!

For baseball prospects, college coaches generally prefer skills videos over game footage. Skills videos allow coaches to evaluate specific abilities like hitting, fielding, pitching mechanics, and overall athleticism in a controlled setting. This format gives them a clearer sense of a player’s fundamentals and potential. \r\nIf you’d like to update Joel’s profile, we can help you create or upload a new skills video.

We do not have a full video to even clip it or upload it to say what play they was running: Also, we did not realize that he could not upload straight from his camera roll so he is going to download hudl and we can do it from there as far as the actual place just so that we’re on the same page. Are you saying that we need to have the entire video uploaded and then from that video we need to clip 35 players or 35 highlights and he needs to title the video or each clip by what play they were running?

We do not have a full video to even clip it or upload it to say what play they was running: Also, we did not realize that he could not upload straight from his camera roll so he is going to download hudl and we can do it from there as far as the actual place just so that we’re on the same page. Are you saying that we need to have the entire video uploaded and then from that video we need to clip 35 players or 35 highlights and he needs to title the video or each clip by what play they were running?

We start with the amount of clips and total run time = 35 max clips / 4 minutes 30 seconds to meet college coach preferences. Clips are arranged to lead with your best plays, maintain flow and consistency, and finish strong. Hudl is the preferred way to edit your clips, it ultimately depends on what you guys need.  I see you play Safety - if you had plays on Offense too, we'd organize them by Defensive and Offensive Plays. I reviewed your first 6 plays and wouldn’t change a thing!!

For baseball prospects, college coaches generally prefer skills videos over game footage. Skills videos allow coaches to evaluate specific abilities like hitting, fielding, pitching mechanics, and overall athleticism in a controlled setting. This format gives them a clearer sense of a player’s fundamentals and potential. \r\nIf you’d like to update Joel’s profile, we can help you create or upload a new skills video.

We do not have a full video to even clip it or upload it to say what play they was running: Also, we did not realize that he could not upload straight from his camera roll so he is going to download hudl and we can do it from there as far as the actual place just so that we’re on the same page. Are you saying that we need to have the entire video uploaded and then from that video we need to clip 35 players or 35 highlights and he needs to title the video or each clip by what play they were running?

We do not have a full video to even clip it or upload it to say what play they was running: Also, we did not realize that he could not upload straight from his camera roll so he is going to download hudl and we can do it from there as far as the actual place just so that we’re on the same page. Are you saying that we need to have the entire video uploaded and then from that video we need to clip 35 players or 35 highlights and he needs to title the video or each clip by what play they were running?
